            <% if parish.name == 'Saint Helier' %>
                'St Helier has a population of about 33,500, roughly 34.2% of the total population of Jersey, and is the capital of the Island (although Government House is situated in St Saviour). The urban area of the parish of St Helier makes up most of town, although some of the town area is situated in adjacent St Saviour, with suburbs sprawling into St Lawrence and St Clement. The greater part of St Helier is rural.

                The parish covers a surface area of 4.1 square miles (10.6 km2), being 9% of the total land area of the Island (this includes reclaimed land area of 494 acres (2.00 km2) or 200 ha).
                Saint Helier is the most populated of Jersey's parishes, with 33,522 residents according to the 2011 census.<br>
                With the Constable, the parish therefore has 11 representatives in the States of Jersey (out of 53 elected members).
                The Parish also has its own responsibilities and elections to the Municipality of St Helier take place to elect honorary officials who fulfill a variety of roles for Parishioners under the overall control of the Constable, two Procureurs du Bien Public and the Parish Assembly.'
            <%elsif parish.name == 'Grouville' %>
                Grouville is in the south east of the island and is dominated by the broad sweep of the Royal Bay of Grouville. The parish covers a surface area of 4,354 vergées (7.8 km²). It borders Saint Clement, Saint Saviour and Saint Martin.
                Population: 4,866 (2011)
            <%elsif parish.name == 'Saint Brelade' %>
                Saint Brélade is one of the twelve parishes of Jersey. Its population is around 9,560, and it occupies the southwestern part of the island. It is the only parish to border only one other parish, St. Peter. The parish is the second-largest parish by surface area, covering 7,103 vergées (3,157 acres or 12.78 km²), which is 11% of the total land surface of the island.
                Its name is derived from a 6th-century Celtic or Welsh "wandering saint" named Branwalator or Saint Brelade (also Branwallder, Broladre, Brelodre, Brélade), who is said to have been the son of the Cornish king, Kenen. He is also said to have been a disciple of Samson of Dol, and worked with this churchman in Cornwall and the Channel Islands. A large section of the Jersey Railway linking La Corbière with Saint Helier ran through the parish between 1870 and 1936.
                St. Brélade has some of the most popular bays in Jersey, with St. Brélade's Bay, Ouaisné, Portelet and parts of both St. Ouen's Bay and St. Aubin's Bay falling within the parish boundaries. The village (or town) of Saint Aubin was originally a fishing port facing St. Helier on the opposite side of St. Aubin's Bay. St Aubin was historically the main centre of population in the parish, but residential development at Les Quennevais has shifted that centre of population.
            <%elsif parish.name == 'Saint Clement' %>
                Saint Clement (Jèrriais: St Cliément) is one of the twelve parishes of Jersey in the Channel Islands. It is in the south east of the Island, and contains some of the suburbs of Saint Helier. It is the smallest parish by surface area, but the second most densely populated. St. Clement stretches west to east from Le Dicq to within a quarter mile of La Rocque harbour (at the end of Rue de la Lourderie). Its surface area is around 1,044 acres (4.22 km2).<br>
                Aside from the two deputies who sit in the States of Jersey and represent the parish, St. Clement also has its own local administration. This, like each of the other eleven parishes, is made up of a Connétable (often referred to as the 'father' of the parish), who is elected for a three-year term and has a seat in the States Chamber, and on the Comité des Connétables; two Procureurs du Bien Public, who are also elected and oversee the finances of the parish; a Recteur (or Rector), responsible for the parish church; members of the parish Honorary Police (made up of Centeniers, Vingteniers and Constable's Officers); and other officers such as churchwardens, roads inspectors, rates assessors and a registrar.
            <%elsif parish.name == 'Saint John' %>
                St. John shares borders with St Mary on its west, Trinity to the east, and St Lawrence and Saint Helier on its south.

                The cliffs of the north coast afford some of the best views in Jersey. After Trinity, it has the second highest point in Jersey at Mont Mado (473 ft). The parish covers territory of 4,846 vergées (8.7 km².).
                The Centre Stone at Sion in St. John is traditionally regarded as the centre of the Island although it is far from the geographic centre by modern calculations. The stone is prehistoric, showing evidence of cup marks, and may have been brought from a nearby dolmen now vanished.
            <%elsif parish.name == 'Saint Lawrence' %>
                Saint Lawrence (Jèrriais: St Louothains) is one of the twelve parishes of Jersey in the Channel Islands. The parish covers 5,258 vergées (9.5 km²) and occupies the centre of the Island.

                Much of the parish is inland, though it has a short stretch of coastline in St. Aubin's Bay. It borders St Peter and St Mary to the west, St John to the north and east, and St Helier to the east.
                Including the Connétable, the parish has three elected representatives in the States of Jersey.

            <%elsif parish.name == 'Saint Martin' %>
                Saint Martin (Jèrriais: St Martîn) is one of the twelve parishes of Jersey in the Channel Islands. Historically it was called "Saint Martin le Vieux" to distinguish it from the present day parish of Grouville (historically "Saint Martin de Grouville").

                St. Martin is the only parish in Jersey not to conduct its municipal business from a Parish Hall. St. Martin has a Public Hall instead, having accepted money from the States of Jersey to provide an assembly room.
                The ancient castle of Mont Orgueil dominates the small harbour and village of Gorey. The castle served as the island's prison until a prison was constructed in St. Helier in the 17th century. Among agitators imprisoned there by the British government were William Prynne and John Lilburne. Until the construction of Elizabeth Castle off St. Helier at the beginning of the 17th century, Mont Orgueil was generally the residence of the Governor of Jersey.

                The 600m breakwater at St. Catherine is all that remains of a grandiose harbour project started, but then abandoned, by the British government in the 19th century. It is now a popular site for sea anglers.

                St. Martin is one of the remaining strongholds of Jèrriais with a distinctive accent. The area around Faldouet formerly possessed a dialect of its own, known as Faldouais, of which the distinctive feature was the realisation of intervocalic /r/ as /z/. Although the Faldouais dialect is extinct, it has left notable amounts of writings in Jèrriais literature.

                The artist Edmund Blampied was born at Ville Brée on 30 March 1886.

                This is one of the most agricultural parishes, and one of the most sought after places to live in the island. It has the best herd of Jersey cattle, some of the largest potato growers and a number of small farmers now cultivating the new “Genuine Jersey”, mainly organic, brand.

                Saint Mary (Jèrriais: Sainte Mathie) is one of the twelve parishes of Jersey in the Channel Islands. It is situated in the north west and covers an area of 3,604 vergées (6.5 km²).

                It borders four other parishes: Saint Ouen, Saint John, Saint Peter and Saint Lawrence. The parish and its eponymous church derive their name from a medieval monastery, probably destroyed during Viking raids some time between the 8th and 10th centuries. In 1042 Duke William gave "Saint Mary of the Burnt Monastery" to the abbey of Cerisy.

            <%elsif parish.name == 'Saint Ouen' %>
                Saint Ouen (Jèrriais: Saint Ouën) is one of the twelve parishes of Jersey in the Channel Islands. It is in the north west of Jersey. The parish is the largest parish by surface area, covering 8,341 vergées (15 km²).

                It is reputed to be the most traditional of the parishes, being the farthest from Saint Helier and with much of the territory of the parish forming a peninsula. Its manor, Saint Ouen's Manor, the seat of the de Carteret family for over eight centuries[citation needed] - is the senior fief in the island, and the influence of that family has also been a factor in the parish's independent-minded approach to its affairs.
                The traditional nickname for St. Ouennais is Gris Ventres (grey bellies) - a reference to the custom of men from the parish to wear jerseys of undyed wool, which distinguished them from men from other parishes who generally wore blue.

            <%elsif parish.name == 'Saint Peter' %>
                  Saint Peter (Jèrriais: St Pièrre) is one of the twelve parishes of Jersey in the Channel Islands. It is in the west central part of the island. It is the only parish with two separate coastlines, stretching from St. Ouen's Bay in the west to St. Aubin's Bay in the south, and thereby cutting St. Brelade off from other parishes. The parish is the fourth-largest parish by surface area, covering 6,469 vergées (11.6 km2 (4.5 sq mi))

                  It borders four other parishes:

                  Saint Ouen to the north
                  Saint Mary to the north-east
                  St Lawrence to the east
                  St Brelade to the south
                  The traditional nickname for St. Pierrais is ventres à baînis (limpet bellies), perhaps because their parish sticks to two coasts like limpets.

                  Trinity (French: La Trinité, Jèrriais: La Trinneté) is one of the twelve parishes of Jersey in the Channel Islands, and located the north east of the island. Les Platons is the highest point in Jersey.

                  Trinity has the reputation of being the most rural of Jersey's parishes, being the third-largest parish by surface area with the third-smallest population. The parish covers 6,817 vergées (12.3 km2 (4.7 sq mi)). It is home to the States Farm, the Durrell Wildlife Park at Les Augrès Manor, the headquarters of the Royal Jersey Agricultural and Horticultural Society at the Royal Jersey Showground, and the Pallot Heritage Steam Museum.
