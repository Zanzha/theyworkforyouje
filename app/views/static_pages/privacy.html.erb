	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	
		<h6>Our privacy policy is very simple:</h6>

				<ol>
					<h5>
						<li>We will not send you unsolicited email.</li>

						<li>We gladly show you the personal data we store about you in order to run the website.</l>

						<li>We guarantee we will not sell or distribute any personal information you share with us.</li>
					</h5>	
				</ol>

			<h4> What is your cookie policy?</h4>	

				<p> We use cookies to save you from having to repeatedly sign in to the site, and also to remember your postcode. We may also use them to record if you've answered one of the survey questions we ask. The site will work with cookies disabled, but it won't be as good.</p>

			<h4> Measuring website usage (Google Analytics)</h4>

				<p> We use Google Analytics to collect information about how people use this site. We do this to make sure it’s meeting its users’ needs and to understand how we could do it better.</p>

				<p>Google Analytics stores information such as what pages you visit, how long you are on the site, how you got here, what you click on, and information about your web browser.</p>

				<p>We have also enabled the Advertising Features of Google Analytics. In particular, we use Demographics and Interest reporting to identify trends in the types of users visiting our site, which may be used for internal reporting and improvement of the site content.</p>

				<p>In technical speak, this allows Google to collect data about your traffic via Google advertising cookies and anonymous identifiers, in addition to data collected through a standard Google Analytics implementation. Regardless of the source of the data, we strictly adhere to Google’s policy requirements in our treatment of your data. We do not facilitate the merging of personally-identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information collected through any Google advertising product or feature.</p>

			<h6>Google’s Official Statement about Analytics Data:</h6>

			<h4>Opting out</h4>

				<p>If you’re unhappy with the idea of sharing the fact you visited our site (and any other sites) with Google, you can install the official browser plugin for blocking Google Analytics.</p>

				<p>If you want to disable advertising-based tracking, you can adjust your Google Ads Settings, or opt out of advertising-based tracking across a number of providers in one go using the Network Advertising Initiative’s opt-out form.</p>

			<h6>Rest assured, we only track usage data for one reason: to help us understand how we can make the site work better for you, our users.</6>
